# How to initialize a Cubot object

#### Example Code 

```java
String[] temp = {"RRRRRRRRR", "GGGGGGGGG", "OOOOOOOOO", "BBBBBBBBB", "WWWWWWWWW", "YYYYYYYYY"}; 
Cubot cube = new Cubot(temp) ; 
``` 

1. First hold the cube with the yellow face pointing upwards and the white face pointing downwards 
2. Add a String element to the String[] you have made with the first letters of each color you see on a face, in row-major order. Make sure to do this in the order - Red, Green, Orange and Blue 
3. Hold the cube such that green face is pointing towards you. Tilt the cube as shown below and add the Strings for the White face and then finally, the Yellow face. 
4. After this String[] is done, you can initalize a Cubot object 

#### Green, White and Yellow Faces for example
